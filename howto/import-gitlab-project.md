## Custom import

Customers and potential ones may want to import a large project into GitLab.com. We hava a script to provide a workaround in a timely manner for them.

The script is https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/raw/master/scripts/project_import.rb

In order to run it we can follow the steps in the template: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/import.md
