# Gitlab On Call Run Books

The aim of this project is to have a quick guide of what to do when an emergency arrives

## What to do when

* [The NFS server `backend4` is gone](troubleshooting/nfs-server.md)

## Adding runbooks rules

* Make it quick - add links for checks
* Don't make me think - write clear guidelines, write expectations

# But always remember!
